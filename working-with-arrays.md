# Working with Arrays  

### Objectives

- What is array
- Declaring of an array
- Instantiation of an array
- Referring particular elements
- Traversing
    - Normal loops (for, while, do-while)
    - Enhanced for loop
- Multi-Dimensional Array


### What is an array?

- An **array** is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a
    single type.
- The length of an **array** is established when the **array** is created.
- The length of the array is fixed.
- Occupy contagious memory location.
- Array also an object.


#### Declaring and initialization of array


### Initialization of an array


### Declaration and initialization


### Referring a particular element using index


### Traversing with loops


### Traversing with Enhanced for loop


### Double Dimension array

- It consist of columns and rows.


### Declaring and initialization â€“ 2D array


### Initialization 2D array


### Traversing 2D array


### Traversing using enhanced for loop


# QUIZ


- What is an array?


An **array** is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a
single type.


- Can we resize the array in run time?


No.


# Exercise


- Write a method to display array elements. Test it by passing different
    arrays.


### Solution


### Questions

- Write a method to get biggest number in the given array.
- Write a method to get sum of all the elements in the array.
- Write a method to find whether given number is present or not in the
    given array
- Write a method to get how many number of times a particular number is
    present in the given array.
- Write a method to delete an element from particular position in the given
    array.
- Write a method to insert an element in a particular position in the array.
- Write a method to display two dimensional array in matrix format.
