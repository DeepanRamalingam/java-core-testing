# Java Language Fundamentals  


### Objectives

- How to learn a language?
- Key words
- Data Types and Wrapper Classes
- Variables
- Operators
- Control Statements


#### How to learn a language?

To learn any language

Learn Alphabets, digits, special symbols
Learn words
Learn sentences
Learn how to write paragraph, pages etc.,


#### How to learn a Programming language?

```
Language Programming Language
Alphabets,digits, special symbols Character Set [A..Z,a..z,0..9]and special
symbols
Words Reserved Words
Sentences -Grammar Statements -Syntax
Writing Paragraphs Functions
Page Program
```

### Key words

**keyword** is one of reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language;
Programmers cannot use **keywords** as names for variables, methods, classes, or as any other identifier


### Data types

**Data type** specifies the size and **type** of values that can be stored in an identifier.


### Variable – declaration - initialization

A **variable** is the name given to a memory location

**Syntax** to declare a variable
Data_type variableName;

**Example**
int x; //it means x is a variable of type int.

We can initialize at the time of declaration itself
int x = 10; // it means x is a variable of type int and holds value 10


### Constant

- A **constant** is a variable whose value cannot change once it has been
    assigned.
- **Java** doesn't have built-in support for **constants** , but the variable
    modifiers static and final can be used to effectively create constant


### Operators in Java

An **operator** , in Java, is a special symbols performing specific operations
on one, two or three operands and then returning a result.


### Control Statements

A program executes from top to bottom except when we use **control statements**.

We can **control** the order of execution of the program, based on logic and values


### If Statement – flow diagram


### Nested if – flow diagram


### Example – If statement


### Example – If - else statement


### Example – else-if statement


### Example – Nested If statement



### Switch – Example - I


### Switch – Example - II


### Looping Statements

- For
- While
- Do while
- Enhanced for loop (will discuss later after arrays/collections)
- Iterator (will discuss later after arrays/collections)
- For each (will discuss later after streams and lambda expression)


### For loop


### For loop - Examples


### While loop


### While loop - examples


### Do – while loop


### Do-while - examples


### While loop Vs Do while loop


### Jump statements

- Break
    - Will come out of the loop
    - Will come out of switch condition
- Continue
    - Continue the loop while skipping remaining statements in the loop
- Return
    - Will come out of method by skipping remaining statements in the method
- **Note: avoid using jump statements without using conditional**
    **statement.**


### Where to use break?


### Where to use continue?


### Jumping statement – break example

```
Note: in for loop, all three parts are optional, but should give semi-colon i.e., ;
```

### Jumping statement – continue example
